# Pulse Demo Flow — HackaTom 2026

> **Core insight**: Pulse is an **operational signal orchestration layer** — AI handles 85% automatically so humans only touch what requires judgment.

---

## 🎯 The Story in One Sentence

*"In healthcare operations, 85% of signals are routine. Pulse orchestrates them automatically — surfacing only the 15% that require human judgment, while giving leadership real-time visibility across locations."*

---

## 🧠 What is a Pulse?

**A Pulse is an operational event that requires tracking, decision, or awareness.**

| Pulse Type | Example | Who Sees It |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Decision Pulse** | €420 bedding from non-contracted supplier | Jolanda (approval needed) |
| **Exception Pulse** | Invoice variance +2.5% above PO | Rohan (reconciliation needed) |
| **Informational Pulse** | Order shipped, arriving tomorrow | Sarah (awareness only) |
| **Auto-Resolved Pulse** | €34 cleaning supplies, auto-approved | Nobody (AI handled it) |

## 🎬 Demo Script (5 minutes) — Orchestration Focus

### OPENING: The Problem (30 seconds)

*"Healthcare organizations drown in operational signals. Purchase requests, maintenance tickets, compliance flags, shift handovers — all competing for attention.*

*The result? Care workers chase paperwork. Managers approve blindly. Finance reconciles manually. Everyone asks: 'What's the status?'*

*Pulse changes this. Watch."*

---

### ACT 1: The Orchestration Dashboard (60 seconds)

**Start on Jolanda's view** (Team Lead)

#### What to show:

1. **The Orchestration Summary** (top of screen)
   - "AI handled **94%** automatically today"
   - "**3 decisions** need your judgment"
   - "**45 minutes** saved vs manual processing"
   
   *"This is the first thing Jolanda sees. Not a list of everything — just what needs her."*

2. **Point to the auto-resolved section**
   - Collapsed by default
   - "12 routine purchases, 8 GL codes, 6 invoices — all handled"
   - *"She doesn't need to see these. AI matched patterns, applied rules, done."*

3. **Show the 3 decision cards**
   - Each has AI reasoning inline (not hidden in a modal)
   - Risk level visible
   - One has urgency glow (breathing animation)
   
   *"These three need human judgment. AI explains why."*

---

### ACT 2: The Decision Moment (60 seconds)

**Stay on Jolanda's view**

#### What to show:

1. **Expand one decision card**
   - €420 bedding from non-contracted supplier
   - AI insight: "34% above Ward C average. Similar spike Oct 2024 was seasonal."
   - *"AI doesn't just flag — it gives context."*

2. **Approve it**
   - ✅ Success animation (checkmark snap)
   - Toast: "Approved — routed to procurement"
   - Card slides out
   
   *"One tap. Full audit trail. Sarah already sees it."*

3. **Show the budget radar** (if time)
   - Three locations side-by-side
   - Het Anker glowing amber (approaching threshold)
   - *"Cross-location visibility. No spreadsheet needed."*

---

### ACT 3: The Exception Handler (60 seconds)

**Switch to Rohan** (Finance)

#### What to show:

1. **The exception-only view**
   - "Rohan doesn't see 42 transactions. He sees 5 exceptions."
   - Tabs: Exceptions (5) | Monitoring
   
   *"AI did the three-way match on 37 invoices. These 5 need him."*

2. **Show one variance exception**
   - MedSupply invoice +2.5% over PO
   - AI: "Within vendor's historical variance (avg 2.2%)"
   - *"AI says: probably fine. Rohan confirms."*

3. **Reconcile with one click**
   - Success animation
   - "Posted to GL. Audit trail created."

4. **Show the pattern detection alert**
   - "Shadow spend alert: €1,240 non-contracted this month (+23%)"
   - *"AI doesn't just process — it detects patterns humans miss."*

---

### ACT 4: The Care Worker Reality (60 seconds)

**Switch to Anouk** (Care Worker)

#### What to show:

1. **The calm interface**
   - "All sorted" or "1 thing needs you"
   - No inbox. No queue. Just clarity.
   
   *"Anouk doesn't manage a system. She does her job."*

2. **Show the one-door input**
   - Voice waveform when tapping mic
   - Quick-tap pills for common actions
   - *"30 seconds to log anything. Voice, photo, or text."*

3. **Show a "Needs Input" card** (if exists)
   - "Your pharmacy receipt needs a GL code"
   - Tap "Provide info" → resolved
   - *"The system tells her exactly what's blocking. She fixes it. Done."*

4. **Show the progress tracker**
   - Animated checkmarks snapping into place
   - "Her request is already with procurement. She didn't chase anyone."

---

### CLOSING: The System-Level Outcome (30 seconds)

**Show the Orchestration Summary again**

*"What you just saw:*

- ***94% of signals handled automatically*** — no human touched them
- ***3 decisions made*** — with full AI context
- ***45 minutes saved*** — per person, per day
- ***Zero 'what's the status?' questions*** — everyone has visibility

*This isn't a purchase tool. This is operational orchestration.*

*Pulse handles the routine. Humans handle the judgment.*

*That's how you give care workers back to care."*

---

## 🎯 Key Messages to Land

| If they remember one thing... | Say this |
|-------------------------------|----------|
| **For care workers** | "30 seconds to log anything. No forms. No chasing." |
| **For managers** | "See only what needs your decision. AI explains why." |
| **For finance** | "Exception handling, not data entry. AI did the matching." |
| **For leadership** | "Cross-location visibility. Pattern detection. Real-time." |

---

## ⚠️ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't demo all 4 personas sequentially** — It becomes a feature parade
2. **Don't open the AI chat overlay repeatedly** — It feels theatrical
3. **Don't show Sarah's procurement view** — It's standard SaaS, not differentiating
4. **Don't explain the workflow linearly** — Show orchestration, not steps

## 🔥 If Emmanuel Asks...

### "What exactly is a Pulse?"
*"An operational event that requires tracking, decision, or awareness. Could be a purchase, a maintenance ticket, a compliance flag. The system treats them uniformly — AI classifies, routes, and resolves what it can. Humans handle what requires judgment."*

### "How is this different from [competitor]?"
*"Most tools digitize the workflow. We orchestrate it. 85% never reaches a human. The 15% that does comes with AI context. That's the difference between a form system and an operational layer."*

### "What about trust? How do people trust the AI?"
*"AI doesn't make decisions — it handles patterns. Every auto-resolution has a confidence score and audit trail. Humans set the thresholds. AI operates within them. Trust builds from transparency, not magic."*

### "How long to implement?"
*"4-6 weeks for first location. We train on your patterns, set your thresholds, integrate with your ERP. Care workers are productive day one — it's simpler than what they have now."*

## 🆕 New "Holy Shit" Moments (v2)

These new features create structural wow — not gimmicks, but moments where the system feels *inevitable*.

### 1. System Health Dot (Header)
**Where**: Next to the Pulse logo
**What**: Subtle animated dot — green/amber/red based on system state
**Demo cue**: *"Notice the dot next to the logo? That's the system's heartbeat. Green means calm. If it turns amber, something needs attention somewhere."*

### 2. Cross-Persona Transition
**Where**: When switching personas via the floating toggle
**What**: Brief overlay showing "Same signals, different perspective"
**Demo cue**: *"Watch what happens when I switch to Rohan..."* [switch] *"Same underlying data, different view. That's the orchestration layer."*

### 3. Inline AI Explainability
**Where**: On any PulseCard, click "Why am I seeing this?"
**What**: Collapsible bullet points with AI reasoning, confidence score
**Demo cue**: *"Click here — the AI explains exactly why this was flagged. No mystery. No black box."*

### 4. Auto-Resolve Undo
**Where**: Hover over any auto-resolved item
**What**: Undo button appears, shows rule applied + time saved
**Demo cue**: *"Every auto-resolution is reversible. Hover here — see the rule it applied, the confidence, the time saved. One click to undo if needed."*

### 5. Exception Density Strip (Rohan)
**Where**: In the Anomaly Heatmap tiles
**What**: Mini bar chart showing exception rate by hour
**Demo cue**: *"See this strip? That's exception density over time. The AI predicted a spike at 3pm — and it happened. Pattern detection in action."*

### 6. Timeline Slider (Executive View)
**Where**: New component — can add to any view
**What**: "Rewind 24h" scrubber showing signal flow over time
**Demo cue**: *"Want to see what happened overnight? Drag this back..."* [scrub] *"...and watch the signals flow through the system. This is your operational nervous system."*

### 7. Calm/Alert Mode
**Where**: Subtle background gradient shift
**What**: Background tints warm when tension rises (pending decisions + urgency)
**Demo cue**: Don't call it out explicitly — let them feel it. If asked: *"You might notice the screen feels slightly different. When there's more pending, the environment subtly shifts. It's designed to be felt, not seen."*

## 🚫 Still Don't Add

- ❌ Confetti
- ❌ Over-the-top 3D
- ❌ AI avatar chat
- ❌ Slack-style command center
- ❌ Futuristic cyber UI

**Healthcare operations. Trust > spectacle.**

## 💡 The Real WOW

The wow isn't animation.

It's when they realize:

> "Wait — 94% never needed a human?"

> "The AI explains *why* it flagged this?"

> "She logged that in 30 seconds?"

> "He only sees 5 exceptions out of 42?"

That's category-level differentiation.

---

*Operational calm. AI intelligence. Human judgment where it matters.*

*That's Pulse.*
